A brand new tool to help with cargo 

The highly advanced technology in Cargo.bat has revolutionized the use of cargo via the
command line. World famous cargo.bat has won multiple international awards for changing the Rust lang 
for the better of humanity. edit-- actually, I use this all the time. It actually greatly
helps speed up dev- when you have to try to compile a ton of times it is great to have a 
tool like this.
