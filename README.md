# cargobat
A brand new tool to help with cargo and rustc

The highly advanced technology in Cargo.bat has revolutionized the use of cargo via the
command line. World famous cargo.bat has won multiple international awards for changing the Rust lang 
for the better of humanity. edit-- actually, I use this all the time. It greatly
helps speed up dev- when you have to try to compile a ton of times it is great to have a 
tool like this. Pro tip- IF you name this "cargo.bat" or "rustc.bat" you will have all sorts of probs. You see,
if Cargo is already installed on your system, now calling "cargo" invokes the bat file AND
cargo! So yeah, do NOT name it cargo.bat or rustc.bat // I name it go.bat as a tribute and a goodbye to Go :)
